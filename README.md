This website needs a total rewrite:
1. It is way too lengthy and needs to be broken up into topic-related pages with an easy to use nav bar and excellent navigation
2. It needs to be recoded as it was orginally written in Adobe Muse which has been discontinued.
3. It needs to be written in html, css and javascript so new links and items can be easily added later on
4. It needs to be responsive and mobile friendly
5. Any images need to be Creative Commons or AI-generated with attribution. Please do not ever use images that might be copyrtight to someone.
6. It should have a feel appropraite for churches, Christian non-profits and small Christian businesses as they are our demographic.
7. If possible give it a multi-cultural feel as we serve folk from all over the world
8. Please add a contact form, link to provacy policy etc (see front page of Cybermissions.Org)
