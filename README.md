# Cybermissions

Cybermissions is a website dedicated to cybersecurity, developed for a Christian organization. 

The goal of the site is to provide information on best practices in cybersecurity, including topics like backups, cyber threats, encryption, security systems, and more. 

This project was developed as part of a volunteer role for an NGO, and all pages are responsive, optimized for accessibility, and follow best security practices.

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a knowledge base on cybersecurity in an accessible and responsive way.

It was developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without heavy frameworks, ensuring simplicity and ease of maintenance.

The website is designed to be intuitive, easy to navigate, and suitable for non-profit organizations.

## Main Objectives

    Responsiveness: The site is designed to adapt to different screen sizes.
    Accessibility: Best practices for accessibility were followed to ensure the site is usable by all.
    Clean Design: Simple, straightforward design tailored for the target audience.

## Technologies Used

This project uses standard web technologies to ensure compatibility and optimal performance:

    HTML5: Semantic structure and content.
    CSS3: Styling with emphasis on responsive design and the use of CSS variables (:root).
    JavaScript: Dynamic functionalities, like the contact form interactivity.
